# AspNetTrainingOne

This is a training project to help orient new developers in our organization. Its purpose is to give a quick overview of some features that new developers might not have been exposed to yet.

The intent is to git pull a commit at a time so the developer can see the "evolution" of the code.

## 1. Initial Commit

The first commit is a "stock" ASP.Net (Framework, not Core) project created with Visual Studio 2019 using .Net Framework 4.7.2.

It has a simple Entity Framework Code First DbContext containing one entity - City.

It uses a Migration to create the database, create the table and populate the table with data using the Seed method.
